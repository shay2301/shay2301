# Shay Leo Levi

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shay Leo Levi, a physicist transitioning into the world of data science with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of medical technology. With a solid foundation in computational models, data analysis, and algorithm development honed during my time at Novocure's Research and Development team, I'm excited to embark on this new journey.

ðŸ”¬ During my time at Novocure, I got deep into the world of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) and how they affect glioblastoma progression. From crunching numbers to playing around with cool algorithms, I've been right in the thick of medical research, helping out with clinical trials and bringing fresh perspectives to the team.

ðŸ’» I love geeking out over data and messing around with machine learning models, especially when it means collaborating with awesome teams on super interesting projects.

ðŸ“š Right now, I'm leveling up my skills at the School of Data Science Ydata program, diving headfirst into deep learning with PyTorch. Graduation's coming up in July 2024, and I'm pumped to bring all this new knowledge to the table.
